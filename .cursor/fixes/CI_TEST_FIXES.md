# CI Test Fixes Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Rollup Native Dependencies Issue
**Problem**: The tests were failing with a missing `@rollup/rollup-linux-x64-gnu` module error.

**Solution**: 
- Removed `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`
- Reinstalled dependencies with `npm install`
- This resolved the Rollup native module compatibility issue

### 2. Deprecated `done()` Callback in Tests
**Problem**: The multiplayer tests were using the deprecated `done()` callback pattern, causing unhandled errors:
```
Error: done() callback is deprecated, use promise instead
```

**Solution**: 
- Converted all WebSocket tests from `done()` callback pattern to modern `async/await` with Promises
- Added proper error handling with try/catch blocks
- Added timeouts to prevent hanging tests
- Ensured proper cleanup of WebSocket connections

### 3. Node-fetch Import Issue
**Problem**: The tests were importing `node-fetch` which is not needed in Node.js 18+ as `fetch` is built-in.

**Solution**: 
- Removed the `import fetch from 'node-fetch'` line
- Used the built-in global `fetch` function instead

## Test Results
After the fixes:
- ✅ All 26 tests passing (23 game tests + 3 multiplayer tests)
- ✅ No unhandled errors
- ✅ CI workflow compatible (server starts and tests run successfully)

## Files Modified
- `src/multiplayer.test.ts` - Modernized test patterns and removed deprecated patterns

## Verification
The fixes were verified by:
1. Running tests locally with `npm run test:ci`
2. Testing the full CI workflow simulation (start server + run tests)
3. Confirming all tests pass without errors or warnings
